### Arpmonitor

	Back in 1999 I needed a way to monitor arp traffic in my local network to debug traffic and devices. There were some tools but I was excited about my ANSI C skills and ended up coding arpmonitor. 19 years later I was joking around on google and found out some references to it in books and troubleshooting archives. Feeling nostalgic I gave it a brush up and uploaded to github. 

	You will find the original README inside the repository. Just make clean; make install ; sudo arpmonitor -p -e -i eth1 and you are set.
